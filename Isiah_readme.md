# Purpose and Format of a README File
A **README File** is a form of text file that holds vital information for the *user* about the software, program, game, or utility. They will almost always contain instruction for the software or extra help for the _user_.
They may also contain information on a programs **patches** or **updates**. Information within a **README File** are often not included with the softwares full documentation or manual, so it would be a smarter idea to read them both.

## Example of a README File
As stated above these files often contain **updates** and **patches** for whatever software it is attached to. For example a PS4 (PLAYSTATION 4) is a video gaming console that updates fairly often. When it does the _user_ is presented with a large text file containing the newest features that have been or will be added due to the **update** via download.
