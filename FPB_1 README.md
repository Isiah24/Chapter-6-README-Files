# Function Practice B #1
A program that uses a function to convert **inches** to **feet**

## Prototypes 
_doublefeetToInches(double valA);_


_voidfeetToInches(double& valB);_

## Directions

1. Review the function descriptions listed below.

2. Write a single program which implements all of the functions assigned, one function at a time.

3. Your program will include the function implementations as well as the main( ) function that reasonably tests each function
assigned. Each function implemented should be called at least twice from the main().

4. Choose your test values for your function calls thoughtfully. Use the prototypes and values listed.

5. Program can be written w/o requiring user input; use programmer defined input for the listed test cases.
