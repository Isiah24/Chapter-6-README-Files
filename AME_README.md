# Signal Speech Analysis

This Program compares two voice files to determine if the sound files match up.

## Variables 

_double_ mean(vector<double>vals);

_double_ stdDev();

_double_ Variance(vector<double> samples);

_double_ avgPower(vector<double> vals);

_double_ avgMagnitude(vector<double> vals);

_double_ zeroCross();

_void_ Diff();

## Text Files
two_a.txt

two_b.txt

% difference



## Directions 
Write a program to read a speech signal from a data file named two_a.txt. This file contains values that represent Maria Estrella's utterance of the word "two".Each line contains a single value representing measurement from the microphone taken in increments of 0.002 seconds.

## Work Effort
My partner and I were able to work very closely together and stay communicating with each other. 
After plotting our Hiearchy chart we both worked on diffrent functions within the program itself to save time.
